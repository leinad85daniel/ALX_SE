[---LS---]

- The ls command is used to list the contents of a directory. It is probably the most commonly used Linux command. It can be used in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:

--> "ls bin"        :List the files in the /bin dierctory (or any othe directory we care to specify)
--> "ls -l"         :List the files in the working directory in long format
--> "ls -l etc bin" :List the files in the etc directory and the bin directory in long format
--> "ls -a"         :List all files (including hidden files)
--> "ls -la .."     :List all files (including hidden files) in the parent of the working directory in long format
--> "ls -r"         :List in reverse order
--> "ls -s"         :List file size

[---COMMANDS OPERATION---]

- Most commands operate like this : "command -options arguments", where command is the name of the command, -options is one or more adjustmets to the command's behaviour, and arguments is one or more "things" upon which the command operates.

- In the case of ls, we see that ls is the name of the command, and that it can gave one or more options, such as -a and -l, and it can operate on one or more files or directions.

[---LONG FORMAT---]

- Structure of long format:

 - -rw-------   1 me       me            576 Apr 17  2019 weather.txt
drwxr-xr-x   6 me       me           1024 Oct  9  2019 web_page
-rw-rw-r--   1 me       me         276480 Feb 11 20:41 web_site.tar
-rw-------   1 me       me           5743 Dec 16  2018 xmas_file.txt

--> File name: 
  - The name of the file or directory
--> Modification time:
  -  The last time the file was modified. If the last modification occured more than six months in the past, the data and the year are displayed. Otherwise, the time of the day is shown.
--> Size:
  -  The size of the file in bytes.
--> Group: 
  - The name of the group that has file permissions in addition to the file's owner.
--> Owner: 
  - The nae of the user who owns the file.
--> File permissions: 
  - The first character is the type of the fiel. 
    - A "-" indicates a regular (ordinary) file.
    - A "d" indicates a directory.
  - The second set of three characters represent the read, write and execution rights of the file's owner
  - The next 3 represent the rights of the file's group
  - The final 3 represent the rights granted to everybody else.

[---LESS---]

- less is a program that lets us view text files. This is very handy since many of the files used to control and configure Linux are human readable.

# There are many ways to represent information on a computer. All methods involve defining a relationship between the information and some numbers that will be used to represent it. Computers, after all, only understand numbers and all data is converted to numeric representation.

# ASCII: is one of the representation systems which is short for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange". 

- The less program is invoked by simply typing: "less text_file"

- Once started, less will display the file one page at a time. We can use the Page Up and Page Down keys to move through the text file.To exit less, we type "q". Here are some commands that less will accept:

--> page up or b.......:Scroll back one page
--> Page down or space.:Scroll forward one page
--> G..................:Go to the end of the text file
--> 1G.................:Go to the beginning of the text file
--> /characters........:Search forward in the text file for an occurrence of the specified characters
--> n..................:Repeat the previous search
--> h..................:Display a complete list less commands and options
--> q..................:Quit

[---FILE---]

- File will examine a file and tell us what kind of file it is. To use it, we type: "file name_of_file"

- The file program can recognize most types of files, such as:

--> ASCII..........................:->The name says it all...........................................(Viewable as text)
--> Bourne-Again shell script text.:->A bash script..................................................(Viewable as text)
--> ELF 64-bit LSB executable......:->An executable binary program...................................(Not viewable as text)
--> ELF 64-bit LSB object..........:->A shared library...............................................(Not viewable as text)
--> GNU tar archive................:->A tape archieve file. A common way of storing groups of files..(Not viewable as text)
--> gzip compressed data...........:->An archive compressed with gzip................................(Not viewable as text)
--> HTML document text.............:->A web page.....................................................(Viewable as text)
--> JPEG image data................:->A compressed JPEG image........................................(Not viewable as text)
--> PostScript document text.......:->A PostScript file..............................................(Viewable as text)
--> Zip archive data...............:->An archive compressed wth zip..................................(Not viewable as text)
