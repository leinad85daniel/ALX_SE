[---FILE SYSTEM ORGANIZATION---]

- The file on Linux are arranged in what is called a "hierarchical directory structure" This means that they are organized in a tree-like pattern of directories, which may contain files and subdirectories.

- The first directory in the file system is called the "root directory". 

[---PWD---]

- Think of the file system tree as a maze, and that we are standing in it. At any given moment, we are located in a single directory. Insode that directory, we can see its files and the pathway to its parent directoru and the pathways to the subdirectories of the directory in which we are standing.

- The directory we are standing in is called the working directory. To see the name of the working directory, we use the "pwd" command.

[---CD---]

- To change the working directory we use the "cd" command. To do this, we type cd followed by the pathname of the desired working directory.

-A pathnames are the routes we take along branches of the tree to the directory we want. They are specified into two:

--> Absolute pathnames
  - It begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch by branch until the path to the desired directory of file is completed. Example: if I type cd /usr/bin, it will take me to the direcory usr and to the directory bin inside usr.
                              
--> Relative pathname
  - It starts from the working directory. To do this, it uses a couple of special notations to represent relative positions in the sile system tree. These special notations are ".(dot)" and "..(dot dot)".

  - The "." notation refers to the working directory itself.
  - The ".." notation refers to the working directory's parent directory.

[A FEW SHORTCUTS]

- If we type "cd" followed by nothing, it will change the working directoyr to our home directory.

- A related shortcut is to type "cd ~" to change the working directory to the home directory.

- If we type "cd ~user_name" : it will change the working directory to the home directory of the specified user.

- "cd -" : will change the working directory to the previous one.

# File names that begin with a period are hidden.
# File names in Linux are case sensitive(File1 and file1 are different files).
# Linux has no concept of a "file extension", you may name files any way you like.
# Do not embed spaces in file names. If you want to represent spaces between words in a file name, use underscore characters.
