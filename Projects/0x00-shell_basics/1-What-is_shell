[---SHELL---]

- The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system.
- On most Linux systems a program called "bash" acts as the shell program. 

[---TERMINAL---]

- It is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell. 

# pressing the up-arrow key returns the previous command.
# pressing the down-arrow key let us get the blak line.

[---OPERATING AS ROOT---]

- If the last character of your shell prompt is #, you are operating as the superuser.
- This means that you have administrative privileges. This can be dangerous, since you are able to delelte or overwrite any file on the system. 
- sudo su [enables you to be a super user]
